# Syntecxhub - Modern Modal Project

A high-performance, accessible modal window built during my internship at **Syntecxhub**. This project utilizes industry-standard practices including the native `<dialog>` element and Glassmorphism UI.

## 🌟 Features
* **Native Dialog API**: Uses `<dialog>` for better accessibility and focus management.
* **Glassmorphism**: Modern backdrop-blur effects for the overlay.
* **Micro-interactions**: Subtle button animations and loading states on submission.
* **Full Accessibility**: Keyboard support (ESC to close) and ARIA labels.
* **Responsive**: Fluid design using CSS `clamp()` for mobile and desktop support.

## 🛠️ Built With
* HTML5 (Semantic)
* CSS3 (Variables, Flexbox, Animations)
* Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
